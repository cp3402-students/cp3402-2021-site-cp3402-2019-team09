# Local Environment

First of all, ensure that you have [ScotchBox](https://box.scotch.io/) [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed as they are the dependencies of this local environment.

Clone [WPDistillery](https://github.com/flurinduerst/WPDistillery) using the command line. <br/>
Install the [Vagrant Hostsupdater](https://github.com/agiledivider/vagrant-hostsupdater) plugin
(```vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater```) <br/>
Double check and edit the ```wpdistillery/config.yml``` if needed. <br/>
Then run ```vagrant up``` from the directory where the ```Vagrantfile``` is located. <br/>
Enter http://192.168.33.10/ on your browser to see if it works properly. <br/>
