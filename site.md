# Site Development

# Adding pages or posts
To add new pages to the website, the individual should be able to access the backend of the website. There is a
sidebar that has the WordPress commands such as editing the appearance, changing the theme and
in this case, adding a page. Hover the mouse on the side bar and when you see the pages icon,
click add new. <br/>
In regard to adding a new paragraph or block, the individual can select which page they wanted to add
a post into then click on the + button located at the navigation bar to add a new block. <br/>


# Plugins
* [The Events Calendar](https://theeventscalendar.com/) <br/>
This plugin was used to store the Townsville Jazz Club's programs. It permitted us to input the event's time, location, price and the actual event page from their social media platform.
In order to add a new event, the developer just need to click "Add Event" from the Event drop down at the backend of the website.
The details of the event such as organisation name, location and prices are already stored in the database therefore, developer just need to select
which one suits the best. <br/>


* [MapPress Maps](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mappress-google-maps-for-wordpress/) <br/>
MapPress Maps was used in the Location page. It visually show where the Jazz Club hold their events. It has a pin location so that users will know where the place is exactly. <br/>
