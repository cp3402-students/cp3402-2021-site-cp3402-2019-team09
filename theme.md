# Underscores Theme
Underscores theme was used to create the basic skeleton for our Websites functions and design.

# Styling
In order to begin editing the php and stylesheet files, you can use inspect element, this feature is especially useful when identifying which
styles to alter the appearance of a specific portion of the site. see example

Another useful tool is show current template, this plugin will display the current pages involved to create the page that is displayed on your screen. along with inspect element, this allows for
easy navigation and editing of the _s theme.

# WPForms
WPForms was used to generate all of our forms used for getting user info, forms are a super easy way to get information from users and have a higher 
likely-hood in being filled out. in order to make a form with WPForms you must first download the plugin from the CMS backend of the site.

Here you are able to create new forms by adding different input fields to form.

Once finished creating a form. the user should be able to add it to a page. Go to edit a page, once in the page editor add a new block. Select WPForms as the
block. And select the name of the Form that you created. And Finished!

# Smart Slider

Smart Slider was used to create the main slider on the landing page. Using SmartSlider is a simple way to create a slider for your WordPress Site! we used to bring
attention to the main home of our site.

#Coloring

We used a basic layout of yellow, white and black, these colours were chosen for the Cohesiveness. Since, each color helps the other stand out. For example, the yellow and white colours
bring a warm and nostalgic feel for the website, whilst the black is used for the footer and title, due to its contrast with the other theme colours. It demands the user's attention.
this is especially useful for colouring portions of the site that we would like the user to notice first i.e membership form.
